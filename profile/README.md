# AltLoc 🚀  

**AltLoc** is a platform that turns self-improvement into a game. The project is actively evolving:  
- **The first version** is already completed with core functionality.  
- **The second version** is being developed with a new concept and a more flexible architecture.  

## 🏗️ Two Versions of the Application  

### 1️⃣ First Version (**Completed**)  
Features:  
- **User registration and authentication** (password or Google login).  
- **Creating categories and tasks**, which can be completed daily.  
- **Gamification**: earn in-game currency and experience points to level up.

- **Minimalist admin panel** with a list of all users.  

### 2️⃣ Second Version (**In Development**)  
A **new concept** based on three key entities:  
- **Identity Matrix** – users define who they associate themselves with (*athlete, linguist, entrepreneur, etc.*).  
- **Characteristics** – personal development directions (*similar to categories*).  
- **Habits** – daily tasks that contribute to self-improvement.
